Welcome to the NetBuster..

1) Download Raspbian Jessie with Desktop and extract the .img from the .zip
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian

2) Use SDFormatter to format the SDHC (sd card)
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4

3) Use Rufus to burn the .img and make it bootable to the SHDC
http://rufus.akeo.ie 

4) Connect keyboard and plug in an ethernet cable into the Rpi3. It will auto DCHP an IP on your local network.

5) Pull the Netbuster code from the repo as git is already installed in the distro.
cd /home/pi 
git clone https://github.com/1337c0d3d00d/NetBuster.git 

6) Initalize the system with the initial setup script to setup the Rpi3 then reboot 
cd NetBuster 
./initial_setup 
reboot 

7) After reboot setup root password, switch to it, update apt-get and then install the required apps and initialize the database
sudo passwd root
<select a new password>
su
<put in new root password>
cd /home/pi/NetBuster
apt-get update
./install_netbuster_packages
reboot

8) Everything now is setup and you are ready to go! Now you can connect securely to the net with your device by doing the following steps:
  - Connect from a device to netbuster.io SSID using 'busterbuster' password
  - Point device browser to 192.168.42.1
  - Select the WAN wifi SSID to get out of the box
  - When it connects and is routing through TOR, there is just lots of debugging output on the webpage but the thing that tells you it worked is the 'bridging connections..'
  - Then just browse to www.whatsmyip.org to see your IP is from some foreign country to verify it is working.
  - Continue to browse securely.

9) [OPTIONAL]: If you want ssh access to the Pi then do this
  - Launch Raspberry Pi Configuration from the Preferences menu
  - Navigate to the Interfaces tab
  - Select Enabled next to SSH
  - Click OK

Please see the FAQ for additional usage such as using the L2P network and other features.

Enjoy!
